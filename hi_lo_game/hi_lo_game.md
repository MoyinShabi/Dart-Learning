Class work

Write an application that will play Hi-Lo games with the user. 

The objective of the
game is for the user to guess the computer-generated secret number in the least
number of tries. The secret number is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
When the user makes a guess, the program replies with HI or LO depending on
whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number. The maximum
number of tries allowed for each game is six. The user can play as many games as
she wants.

Use loops and conditionals
